  - name: report

    short: 'get messages from specified time interval'
    long: |
      Get messages added between {{mono "since"}} and {{mono "until"}} (if latter is omitted, current time is used).
      
      Timestamps can be specified in one of the following formats:
      - full date & time {{mono "dd.mm.yyyy HH:MM"}}
      - only date {{mono dd.mm.yyyy"}} (midnight is assumed)
      - only time {{mono HH:MM}} (current date is assumed)
      - relative systemd-like negative time intervals:
        - {{mono -1d}} - 24 hours before "now"
        - {{mono -1h}} - 1 hour before "now"
        and so on.
      
      Currently all timestamps are considered to be in UTC.
